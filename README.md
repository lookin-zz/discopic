## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Get a free API key from [CoinAPI.io](https://www.coinapi.io/)
   - Sign up for a free account

## How It Works

### Arbitrage Calculation

The monitor compares prices across exchanges for the same trading pair:

```
Buy Price = Lowest ask price across all exchanges
Sell Price = Highest bid price across all exchanges

Gross Profit = (Sell Price - Buy Price) / Buy Price * 100%
Net Profit = Gross Profit - (Buy Fee + Sell Fee)
```

### Example

- **BTC/USDT** on Binance: $42,000
- **BTC/USDT** on Coinbase: $42,500
- **Potential Profit**: ~1.19% (before fees)
